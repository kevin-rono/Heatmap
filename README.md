# GPS Track Heatmaps

A heatmap is a graphical representation of a 2-D array using different colors to represent different ranges of values. This application is search-and-rescue: given a GPS track, I implemented the functionality of visualizing where in the search area the track hasn't been as often so that future search efforts can be focused on those locations.

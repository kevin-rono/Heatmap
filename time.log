I discussed my solution with: Jarret, Jonathan, Ekow, Leslie, Alina, David, Phileana.

Debugging the segmentation faults was difficult because of the intricacies of keeping track of all the allocated space and pointers.  
Using printf  statements  and gdb helped tremendously, as did discussing my logic
with the TAs and friends. The other major problem was coming up with the concepts
to write the functions of the ADT. The numerous for loops, pointers and segmentation faults
were a lot to debug. It was also difficult to keep track of the indices of the all the segments, and trkpoints
I was working with in each function and ended up spending a lot of time debugging seg faults.
I learned the importance of trying to map out my thoughts and having diagrams.  The last bug ended up being
using the same variable names in different functions without having initialized them.
